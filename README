simple test-code to play around with clangs tooling

tough stuff, i don't understand it, but it seems to work...

there are two cmake-based dirs (test and cpp) which can be coordinated by a simple
makefile here in this dir. just to:

{{{
    make execute
}}}

to do the compete chain:

1) compiling the InPlaceReplace and test-application (compiling the second is
   needed because of the compile_commands.json)
2) running it to replace some code
3) display the git diff...

also, the following two are nice time-safers:

{{{
    make restore            # git-cleaning the testdir
    make clean          # git-cleaning the testdir and removing all build dirs
}}}
